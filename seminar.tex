\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
This chapter describes the motivation for using and creating domain-specific modeling languages. 
It also gives a brief overview over the contents of these paper.

\subsection{Motivation}
For centuries people from da Vinci to Einstein have created models [\ref{def:model}] to help them better 
understand patterns and processes in the world around them. Nowadays computers and smartphones have 
become an integral part of our everyday life, making it easier to build our own models and learn new ideas in the process.
The majority of the users of these devices has few or even no programming skills at all.
Therefore if these users want to have their own models implemented, specialists need to be engaged to create software based on the users requirements. 

In traditional software development these specialists include project-leaders, analysts, developers that need 
to communicate with each other and the end-user, which can be error prone.
Each of these specialist perceives different aspects of the requirements as important and therefore creates a different mental model
and the resulting software may not correspond to the end-users needs. 
Figure \ref{fig:swingexample} shows an example how different requirements are perceived by the stakeholders in the traditional software development process:
An end-user explains the requirements to the project-leader, who removes details that are perceived not relevant for the software.
Often, the decision if a detail (e.g. additional swing seats) is relevant for the solution is made unconsciously. 
As the project leader communicates the requirements to an analyst, the analyst adds and removes other details 
to his personal mental model that are perceived relevant. So does a programmer who implements the requirements as a software.
As a result the implemented software may not be as the end-user really needed.

To avoid errors originating from the communication between the end-user and other stakeholders (e.g. project-leader, analyst, developer), 
it is desirable to empower the end-user to implement his own models. 
One approach to achieve this goal is by providing domain-specific modeling languages to support an 
end-user in implementing his own models using languages using terms and concepts from a domain that he understands.

\subsection{Road Map}
This paper includes different aspect of domain-specific modeling languages:
Section \ref{section:fundamentals} gives a brief introduction into the fundamentals of domain-specific modeling languages.
In section \ref{section:dsml} different  modeling languages languages are presented that allow end-users with few or no
programming skills to implement their own models in software.
Additionally, section \ref{section:creatingdsmls} of this paper presents the tools Xtext and GMF to create different kinds of domain-specific modeling languages
based on meta-models utilizing the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF).

% \begin{itemize}
%  \item can help experts and novices builing Models for different domains
%  \item enables novices with few or even no programming skills at all to implement their own models (e.g. MindStorm,Starlogo)
%  \item supports domain experts by setting focus on the domain-specific problems (e.g. SimuLink,BPMN)
%   \end{itemize}

\section{Fundamentals}
\label{section:fundamentals}
This section gives a brief overview over the fundamentals of domain-specific modeling languages 
and the terms used in the following sections. This includes Definitions of the terms \emph{model} (Def. \ref{def:model}), 
\emph{domain} (Def. \ref{def:domain}) and \emph{domain-specific modeling languages}.

\begin{defn}
    \label{def:model}
    A \underline{model} is a formal representation of entities and relationships in the real world (abstraction) 
    with a certain correspondence (homomorphism) for a certain purpose (pragmatics) \cite{stachowiak1973allgemeine}.
\end{defn}
This definition contains three aspects: abstraction, homomorphism and pragmatics.
A model should create a simplified view on the represented entities and relationships and 
only contain details, which are relevant for a given application scenario (abstraction).
Additionally statements on the model elements should hold for the represented entities and relationships (homomorphism).
The question, which details are relevant and therefore should be included in the model is determined by the purpose of a model (pragmatics).  
\\\\
Creating models is something we do in our everyday lives:
When building a house using LEGO blocks a child creates a model which serves as a representation for a building in the real world.
It is a simplified view on the original as it abstracts from details, like used materials, installed cables and water pipes and focuses
on the shapes of the building. Another example for creating models is an architect, who creates blueprints for a house, serving as a model for it.
Blueprints contain 2D projections of walls and installations from different viewpoints and abstract from the original by omitting
details like materials and some 3D information. As one can see from these examples, these abstractions also contain a representational bias:
Electric cable installations and water pipes cannot be expressed with LEGO but can with blueprints.
LEGO models, on the other hand, allows to model 3D structures while blueprints cannot.
In this example, the child and the architect have different views on the same thing (houses), but share a common understanding the real world.
Despite their different level of expertise, both the child and the architect know that the concepts \textit{wall} and \textit{roof} 
are related to parts of a building and that a house needs both to be a valid house.
Based on this examples one can define the term \textit{domain} as follows:
\begin{defn}
\label{def:domain}
A \underline{domain} is the common knowledge of the requirements, concepts and functionality in a field of application.
\end{defn}
Based on Def.\ref{def:model} and Def.\ref{def:domain} we define the term \emph{domain-specific modeling language}:
\begin{defn}
\label{def:domain}
A \underline{domain-specific modeling language} is a textual or graphical representation of the concepts, entities and relationships that are 
relevant for a specific domain.
\end{defn}
One can distinguish two types of domain-specific modeling language modeling languages:
While \emph{textual modeling languages} use textual descriptions to represent entities and relationships from the real world,
\emph{graphical modeling languages} use graphical shapes, lines and arrows for the same purpose.
The same model may be expressed in both, a graphical or textual modeling languages.
For example: A finite state machine can be represented as a set of nodes, labeled boxes and arrows, while it can also be 
represented by a textual description following a grammar to represent the same finite state machine as seen in Fig. \ref{compare:textgraphiclang}.
\begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{images/GraficalTextualComparison.PNG}
      \captionof{figure}{Comparison between textual modeling language and graphical modeling language for the same model of a finite state machine.}
      \label{compare:textgraphiclang}
\end{figure}
The decision whether a graphical modeling language or textual modeling language is chosen for the implementation of a modeling tool 
may also be influenced by the targeted audience: A software-developer has a deep knowledge in using text-based editors, while 
children may not have these kind of expertise and therefore prefer a more graphical representation. 
Different levels of expertise can also be observed with regards to domain knowledge:
A software-developer probably has a more detailed knowledge in the computer science domain compared to a medical doctor.


 \section{Domain-Specific Modeling Languages}
 \label{section:dsml}
 As there is a variety of software tools available, which implement different modeling languages, this section will give an overview 
 about modeling languages designed to support users with few or even no programming languages in creating models and help them better 
 understand patterns and processes in the world around them.
 
 \subsection{StarLogo TNG}
  %enable students to build simulations and learn features of complex systems without extensive background knowledge (Klopfer et al., 2009a; 2009b)
  %provides an environment for building agent-based models
  StarLogo is a client based modeling software, developed specifically to enable students to 
  create models for the simulation of complex systems without extensive programming skills \cite{klopfer2009starlogo}.
  It provides a graphical modeling language using blocks instead of a textual syntax. 
  These blocks are coloured based on the function they have in the program and their shapes only allow syntactically correct constructs \cite{klopfer2009starlogo}.
  This eases the learning of basic programming concepts such as control-flow (e.g. loops, if-then statements),
  assignments and methods by providing intuitive graphical mappings. Since StarLogo TNG uses these puzzle-piece shapes, understanding 
  control-flow, for example, ``requires little more than visually parsing the if or repeat commands 
  to conclude that items placed within the then slot will be performed if the items placed within the 
  test slot are true, or the items placed within the do slot will be subject to the number of repetitions placed within the times slot''\cite{smith2011biology}.
  Using puzzle-piece shapes for basic programming concept avoids syntactic errors, 
  which are one of the main difficulties in learning textual programming languages.
  Figure \ref{fig1} shows an exmaple for the blocks used by StarLogo TNG: 
  the curved shape of a Boolean variable is easy to distinguish from the pointed shape of a number value.
  
  \begin{figure}[H]

  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/StarLogoTNGBlocksEx.PNG}
	\caption{ StarLogo TNG’s graphical programming blocks. Example: \texttt{if} (left) and \texttt{repeat} (right) blocks are shown. The
	  if block commands a Turtle agent to take two steps forward if it is green; the repeat block commands an agent to
	  repeat five times the sequence of turning right 15 degrees and taking one step forward. (from \cite{smith2011biology})}
	\label{fig1}
  \end{figure}
  
  %   \begin{itemize}
%   \item is a client-based modeling and simulation software
%   \item enables secondary school students and teachers to model decentralized systems through agent-based programming
%   \item facilitates the creation and understanding of simulations of complex systems
%   \item graphical programming blocks instead of text-based computer code
%   \end{itemize}

   \subsection{Scratch}
  Scratch is graphical modeling languages for visual programming that allows users (primarily ages 8 to 16 \cite{maloney2010scratch}) to learn
  computer programming while working on personally meaningful projects such as animated stories and games. 
  A major design goal of Scratch is to support self-directed learning through tinkering and collaboration with peers \cite{maloney2010scratch}. 
  Scratch uses blocks (Fig.\ref{subfig:highlightconcepts}) similiar to StarLogo TNG for creating models. One of the key features of Scratch is that it is always \emph{live},
  which means that there is no compilation step or edit/run mode distinction. A user can see what a command or program fragment does by clicking 
  it at any time. This also implies that a user can change parameters or add new blocks to a script while it is running.
  Because it is live, Scratch encourages users to experiment with it and supports
  a bottom-up approach to writing scripts where small chunks of program fragments are assembled and tested, then combined into larger units.
  Additionally, Scratch provides visual feedback to show script execution by surrounding a script with a white border when it is 
  running (Fig. \ref{scratchlive}). This feedback
  helps the user understand when scripts are triggered and how long they run. If an error is encountered then the border of the 
  affected script turns red and the block that caused the error is highlighted in red. 
  Furthermore Scratch eliminates the need for syntax error messages by using 
  puzzle-piece shapes which only fit where it makes sense. Additionally, Scratch tries to avoid runtime errors by making all blocks be
  \textit{failsoft}. ``Rather than failing with an error message, every block attempts to do something sensible even when presented with out-of-range inputs''\cite{maloney2010scratch}.
  Even though eliminating the runtime error messages does not eliminate the errors, by following this approach, a script can always be tested by the user.
  %Since a program that can be tested even if the result is incorrect, it is favoured to not be able to run or compile it at all.

  \subsection{PhyDSL}
  Both StarLogo and Scratch use graphical modeling languages for creating models. 
  \emph{PhyDSL} is a tool, designed as an Eclipse plugin that uses a textual modeling language for creating models for the game development domain.
  It was designed for the purpose of supporting the fast prototyping of physics-based games, including platform, shoot ’em up, 
  puzzle and maze games \cite{guana2014phydsl}. 
  The provided frontend includes a text editor (including syntax highlighting and text completion), which is used to define gameplay in highlevel
  terms describing the gameplay static, dynamic elements and their behaviors by a domain-specific modeling language.  
  It is based on the \emph{Eclipse Modeling Framework}\cite{gronback2009eclipse} (EMF) and uses codegeneration for deriving C\# code supported by Microsoft’s
  DirectX API. 
  The modeling language provided by PhyDSL consists of four gameplay definition sections: mobile and
  static actor definition (Fig. \ref{actordef}), 
  environment and layout definition (Fig. \ref{envdef}), 
  activities definition (Fig. \ref{activitiesdef}), 
  and scoring rules definition (Fig. \ref{rulesdef}).

   \subsection{LEGO Mindstorms}
   Another example for a graphical modeling language made for novices is the EV3 Programmer App \ref{fig:ev3app}
   for LEGO Mindstorms which includes a block-based graphical modeling langue for creating programms
   for the LEGO MindStorm Robots. Programs are loaded and executed on a EV3 Programmable Brick (Fig. \ref{ev3pbrick}), 
   which offers input and output connections for interaction with sensors and actuators.
   Different colors are used to indicate whether a blocks triggers some action (green; Fig. \ref{fig:actionblocks}), is used for flow control (orange; Fig. \ref{fig:flowblocks}),
   reads data from some input (e.g. color sensor)(yellow; Fig.\ref{fig:sensorblocks}) or trigger some data operation (e.g. read/write some variable) (red; Fig. \ref{fig:operationsblocks}).

    \section{Creating Domain-Specific Modeling Languages}
    \label{section:creatingdsmls}
    Domain-Specific Modeling Languages are implemented in various software tools using textual or graphical modeling languages.
    In fact, there are approaches to define these modeling languages as models using some kind of meta-language.
    Xtext and GMF are implementions for the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF), which adopt this approach.
    
    \subsection{Xtext}
    Xtext is a framework for development of programming languages and domain-specific modeling languages \cite{eysholdt2010xtext}.
    It uses a syntax similar to extended backus-naur form (EBNF) to describe custom textual modeling languages. 
    From this modeling language definition Xtext generates a custom Text-Editor for Eclipse whose features include code-completion and syntax-highlighting
    as well as a parser for parsing models from text files specified in the defined grammar. This makes it easy for experts of the language design
    domain to create models for custom modeling languages without programming skills or knowledge on how to implement a parser.
    As the modeling language definitions are stored in the Ecore format \footnote{Ecore is a (meta-)model included in the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF), which is used to describe with elements, attributes and relationships are allowed 
    in a model. It is an implementation of the \emph{Meta Object Facility} (MOF) Standard \cite{mof20062}, specified by the OMG.}, other tools in the EMF framework can process data from the parsed 
    models (e.g. Acceleo\cite{musset2006acceleo} for performing codegeneration).  

    \lstset{
  caption={Xtext grammar of a textual modeling language for finite state machines. 
      Figure \ref{compare:textgraphiclang} contains an textual description of a state machine 
      which follows this grammar definition.}, 
  basicstyle=\footnotesize, frame=tb,
  xleftmargin=.05\textwidth, xrightmargin=.05\textwidth
}
\begin{lstlisting}[captionpos=b, label={fig:fsmgrammar}]
FSM: 
  "States:" (states+=State) (",")?)* 
  "Transitions" (transitions+=Transition (",")?)*;
State: 
  id=ID isStarte?="(start)" isStop?="(stop)";
Transition: 
  fromState=[State] "-" (input)? "->" toState=[State];
\end{lstlisting}
%     \begin{itemize}
%       \item used to create textual DSLs for ecore (meta-)models designed in EMF
%       \item syntax similar to EBNF
%       \item one rule for each (meta-)model element
%     \end{itemize}
%    
    \subsection{GMF}
    The Eclipse Graphical Modeling Framework(GMF \cite{gmf}) provides a generative component and runtime infrastructure for developing 
    editors for graphical modeling languages for models created in the Eclipse Modeling Framework.
    For creating a graphical modeling language a domain model must be given in the Ecore format.
    GMF uses a mapping model for the generation of a eclipse plugin for a custom graphical modeling language for the provided domain model. 
    Each element of the domain model is mapped to an element of a graph model, containing user defined shapes and arcs as representations for elements 
    and relationships of the domain model. Fig \ref{mapmodel} shows which models are used for the creation of a custom graphical modeling language.
    This example uses the finite states machine domain model, which must be predefined using Ecore. 
    The Ecore model contains elements like ``Finite State Machine'', ``Transition'' , ``State'',``StartState'', ``EndState'', ... .
    Additionally a graph model must be created, which contains all the shapes that we want to 
    use as a representation for some element from the domain model. This includes circles for Start- and EndState , Boxes for States,
    and arrows for transitions. To actually assign a shape to some domain model element a reference between model element from the domain model 
    and some shape of the graph model must be added to the mapping model. Finally one has to define which elements can be created using the context 
    menu in the generated graphical editor.

\section{Summary}\label{sec:summary}
Domain-specific modeling languages allow novices to build and explore  their own models and learn new scientific ideas in the process.
An overview over different domain specific modeling languages and the features they provide for 
supporting novices in the process of creating valid models is provided.
The modeling languages were selected due to their focus on supporting novices with few or even no programming skills.

Additionally it is presented how domain specific modeling languages can be created using some kind of meta-languages
for describing both custom textual and graphical modeling languages using Xtext and GMF as an example.

The presented tools for creating custom textual and graphical modeling languages could be used in for the simple creation of new intuitive and 
novice orientated modeling languages for other domains. PhyDSL is some exmaple, how Xtext can be used to create textual domain-specific modeling languages 
for novices was and future research project may use Xtext and GMF or similiar tools for fast developent of specialised domain-specific modeling languages.
