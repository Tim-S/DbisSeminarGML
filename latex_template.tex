\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
For centuries of people from da Vinci to Einstein have 
created models to help them better understand patterns and 
processes in the world around them. Nowadays computers \& smartphones make it easier 
for both novices and domain experts to build and explore 
their own models and learn new scientific ideas in the process.

\begin{itemize}
 \item can help experts and novices builing Models for different domains
 \item enables novices with few or even no programming skills at all to implement their own models (e.g. MindStorm,Starlogo)
 \item supports domain experts by setting focus on the domain-specific problems (e.g. SimuLink,BPMN)
  \end{itemize}


\subsection{Foundation}
\label{subsec:introduction}

\subsubsection{Model}
\begin{itemize}
 \item What is a model? (Definition  [Stachowiak]
 + some Explanation)
 \item Abstraction: Remove details which do not serve the purpose

 \item Homomorphism: Statements on model elements hold for real world entities
 \item Pragmatics: Model has some purpose
 \item + example (novice) house Made of LEGOS $\rightarrow $ Model for a ``real'' house / building
 \item + example (expert) blueprints from an architekt $\rightarrow $ different model, but  represents same object in real 
 world
 
 \item Abstraction brings representational bias 
 \item $\rightarrow$ electric cable installations, water pipes cannot be ``expressed'' in lego but they can with blueprints
 \item $\rightarrow$ lego allows 3D Modeling while Blueprints cannot (oonly via 2d projections/ optical illusions)
 \end{itemize}
  
\subsubsection{Domain}
\begin{itemize}
 \item novice and expert have different views on the same thing  but use different models / languages
 \item both models may be used in the context of a domain (Architekture)
 \item What is a Domain? (Definition + some Explanation)
  \end{itemize}
  
 \subsection{Domain Specific Languages}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item different approaches :  Graphical Modeling Languages, Textual Modeling Languages

    \end{figure}
 
 \item examples (domain experts): BPMN , SimuLink
 \item examples (novice ): STARLOGO 
 \end{itemize}
 
 \section{Existing Modeling Languages}
 
 \subsection{StarLogo TNG}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item is a client-based modeling and simulation software
  \item enables secondary school students and teachers to model decentralized systems through agent-based programming
  \item facilitates the creation and understanding of simulations of complex systems
  \item graphical programming blocks instead of text-based computer code
  \end{itemize}
  
  \begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/StarLogoTNGBlocksEx.PNG}
	\caption{ StarLogo TNGâ€™s graphical programming blocks. Example if (left) and repeat (right) blocks are shown. The
	  if block commands a Turtle agent to take two steps forward if it is green; the repeat block commands an agent to
	  repeat five times the sequence of turning right 15 degrees and taking one step forward.}
	\label{fig1}
  \end{figure}
  
   \subsection{Snatch}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Graphical Modeling Language (similar to StarLogo)
  \item developers goal: ``make it easy for everyone,
of all ages, backgrounds, and interests, to program
their own interactive stories, games, animations, and
simulations, and share their creations with one another''
  \end{itemize}
